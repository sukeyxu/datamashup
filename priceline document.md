####**Data Cleaning Assessment**
This file is pretty established when I get it. But the format is still problematic. There are some narrative documentation and description about the file above the table. I need to move them to another text file for future reference. And I also deleted some irrelavant columns. Some works are expected to be done, when I get other data and try to combine data sets together.  
data cleaning time: less than 15 mins.
